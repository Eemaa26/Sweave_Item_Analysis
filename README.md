to record console input and output.
Such a format is useful for several purposes including
R tutorials, informal analyses, and analyses that will be consumed
by readers knowledgeable about a specific project and about R.
The example involves performing an item analysis of 
student responses  
to a set of multiple choice test items.
The test items were developed by students as part of an informal
class exercise.
They are by design of widely varying quality and difficulty.
